# EDL-Director

![build workflow](https://github.com/emrysblack/EDL-Director/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

EDL Director is an application designed to take an [EDL file] (http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/edl.html), and apply changes to
a corresponding video file allowing easy changes to a video. Muting and skipping
are supported.

This can be useful for doing things such as removing commercial breaks, muting loud
noises or undesired language etc.

As of right now, few video players actually support [EDL files] (http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/edl.html), this application is useful
to make an edited file that will playback on any player that would read the original.
